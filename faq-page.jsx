    prefix: "start",
    title: "Getting Started",
    items: [
    {
      q: "Do I need to know any Japanese before starting?",
      a: "Not at all. Most students start as complete beginners. I'll begin from where you are — even if that's hiragana from scratch — and build at a pace that feels comfortable for you."
    },
    {
      q: "What does a trial lesson look like?",
      a: "A relaxed 30-minute conversation. I'll ask why you want to learn Japanese, what your trip or goals look like, and guide you through a small piece of real Japanese. No tests, no pressure — just a chance to see if learning with me feels right for you."
    },
    {
      q: "What if I'm shy about speaking?",
      a: "That's very normal. Lessons are designed so you build confidence slowly — I'll start small, use phrases you'll actually want to say, and there's no pressure to be perfect. Many students who started shy now speak comfortably."
    }]

  },
  {
    prefix: "lessons",
    title: "Lessons & Learning",
    items: [
    {
      q: "How long are the lesson sessions?",
      a: "Trial lessons are 30 minutes, so you can meet me without pressure. Regular private lessons are 50 minutes, which gives time for a warm-up conversation, focused learning, speaking practice, and a short review without rushing."
    },
    {
      q: "What level are these lessons for?",
      a: "Beginner-friendly through lower intermediate. Lessons are most useful for travelers, hobby learners, and anyone who wants practical Japanese for real conversations rather than test prep."
    },
    {
      q: "Can I focus on specific topics like travel, food, or culture?",
      a: "Absolutely. Lessons are personalized — I can spend time on travel phrases, Kyoto-area culture, anime and manga vocabulary, restaurant Japanese, or anything else you're drawn to."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I get materials after the lesson?",
      a: "Yes. After each lesson, you'll receive lesson notes, a vocabulary list, and optional homework on your personal dashboard, so you can review anytime between lessons."
    }]

  },
  {
    prefix: "schedule",
    title: "Scheduling",
    items: [
    {
      q: "How do I book a lesson?",
      a: "Trial lessons are booked through Cal.com — you'll pick a time that works for both of us. After the trial, continuing students book directly with me by message so I can build a rhythm that suits your week."
    },
    {
      q: "What happens if I need to reschedule?",
      a: "Life happens. You can reschedule up to 24 hours before your lesson at no charge — just send me a message and I'll find a new time that works for you."
    },
    {
      q: "What time zones do you work with?",
      a: "Lessons are based in Japan time, and I'm flexible with students in Asia, Europe, and parts of North America. I'll find a time that fits your schedule during the trial."
    }]

  },
  {
    prefix: "payment",
    title: "Payments",
    items: [
    {
      q: "How much do lessons cost?",
      a: "Trial lessons are $20 for 30 minutes. Single private lessons are $40 for 50 minutes. The Beyond Starter Plan is $140 for 4 personalized lessons — a gentle beginner-friendly journey designed for steady progress."
    },
    {
      q: "How do I pay?",
      a: "Trial lessons are paid through the Cal.com booking page. For continuing lessons and the Starter Plan, I accept Wise and PayPal for easy international payments."
    },
    {
      q: "Do lesson packs expire?",
      a: "There's no harsh expiry. Lessons in the Starter Plan can be used at your own pace across several weeks or months. If life gets busy, I'll keep things flexible — just pause and resume when you're ready."
    }]

  },
  {
    prefix: "travel",
    title: "Travel & Practical Japanese",
    items: [
    {
      q: "I'm visiting Japan soon. How early should I start?",
      a: "Even a few lessons before your trip make a real difference. If you're flexible, starting 4–8 weeks before travel gives time to build the core phrases that come up at konbini, restaurants, stations, and shops."
    },
    {
      q: "Do you teach polite Japanese, casual Japanese, or both?",
      a: "Both — naturally. I'll focus on the polite forms you'll need with shopkeepers, station staff, and new people, and add casual expressions for when you're chatting with friends or watching shows."
    },
    {
      q: "Will you help me prepare for specific situations on my trip?",
      a: "Yes. If you tell me your itinerary or the situations you're most nervous about — ordering at an izakaya, asking for directions, checking in at a ryokan — I'll help you practice them before you go."
    }]

  },
  {
    prefix: "tech",
    title: "Technical Questions",
    items: [
    {
      q: "What platform do lessons happen on?",
      a: "Lessons take place over Zoom. You'll get a calendar invite with the link once you book. No special software is needed — just a quiet space and a stable internet connection."
    },
    {
      q: "Do I need a textbook?",
      a: "No textbook required. All materials, notes, and vocabulary lists are provided through your personal student dashboard, which you can access anytime between lessons."
    },
    {
      q: "What if my internet drops mid-lesson?",
      a: "It happens. If the call drops, just rejoin — I'll be waiting. If it won't reconnect, I'll reschedule the remaining time at no charge."
